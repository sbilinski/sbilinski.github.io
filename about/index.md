My name is Szymon Bili≈Ñski and I'm a software developer from Poland with about 10 years of experience.

I started my professional journey with the JVM and have been working on top of this platform ever since. Despite being focused on the backend side, I like to consider myself a full-stack developer with a broad range of skills and professional interests. I enjoy working with [Agile](http://agilemethodology.org/), believe in [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), continuous delivery and [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

To find out more about me and my skills, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szymonbilinski) profile and my open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbilinski).
