My name is Szymon Bili≈Ñski and I'm a software developer from Poland with over 8 years of experience.

I started my professional journey with Java and have been working on top of this platform ever since. Despite being focused on the backend side, I like to consider myself a full-stack developer with a broad range of skills and professional interests. I enjoy working with [Agile](http://agilemethodology.org/), believe in [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), continuous delivery and [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). My personal projects are usually written in Scala.
