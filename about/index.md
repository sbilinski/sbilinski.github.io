I'm a **software engineer** from [Sopot, Poland](https://www.google.com/search?q=sopot%2C+poland).

My journey with computers started around 1999, when I got my first programming book, and began playing with Linux at the same time. I got hooked and a few years later received a master's degree in **Computer Science** from [Gdansk University of Technology](https://eti.pg.edu.pl).

Professionally, I've been working on various commercial projects for **10+** years now. I enjoy switching business domains and technologies, as it keeps things interesting. Some industry highlights include: mobile advertisement, online travel, insurance, education, e-commerce and - most recently - process engineering for the chemical industry.

For the past few years I've been in various **tech lead** roles, including several highly distributed, remote-first engineering teams. We usually work in an Agile process, which emphasises transparency and open communication in all aspects of our daily routine.

My day-to-day work involves a mix of **application development**, **operations** and **organisational** activities. In all those aspects of work, I believe that a synergy of soft and technical skills is essential for any project's success.
